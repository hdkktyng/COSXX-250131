# Solving cos x = x by Iteration

This project visualizes the iterative function `x(n+1) = cos(x(n))` using JavaScript and Chart.js.  
It helps students understand how the function converges numerically.

## Features
- Cobweb plot visualization
- Time evolution graph
- Interactive controls (step, run, stop, reset)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser
3. Use the UI controls to explore the behavior of the cosine map

## Dependencies
- Chart.js (MIT License)

## About This Project

This project was created for educational purposes to help students understand the iterative behavior of the function `x(n+1) = cos(x(n))`.  

The development of this project was done collaboratively with the assistance of ChatGPT, which provided coding guidance and conceptual clarifications.
